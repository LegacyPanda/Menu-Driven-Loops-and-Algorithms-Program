# Menu-Driven-Loops-and-Algorithms-Program

## What I need to do
- Create a menu-driven program which makes use of the following types of loops as appropriate: 
  while, do-while, for, for-each. You need to use each specific loop type at least once in the 
  assignment.  
- Your program should present the user with the following options: 
  ‚Ä¢ Option A: Your program must output the following sequence (the number of terms in 
    the sequence is given by the user): 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 (Fibonacci 
    number1) 
  ‚Ä¢ Option B: Your program must calculate the sum of ùëõ Fibonacci numbers (ùëõ is given by 
    the user) 
  ‚Ä¢ Option C: Your program must accept a string from the user and use it to create and 
    output a palindrome2. For example: 
    ‚ó¶ if the user enters the string ‚Äúrace‚Äù, your program must output ‚Äúracecar‚Äù 
    ‚ó¶ If the user enters the string ‚Äúten‚Äù, your program must output ‚Äútenet‚Äù 
    ...and so forth. 
  ‚Ä¢ Option X: The program must exit

- I have to test the Fibonacci sequence using recursive function 
- When using the fibonacci to use in the array, in order for the value to change there should the initial value adding the i (conditioner)
- for(int i = 0; i < intValue; i++>)
  {
    intSequence[i] = fibonacci(intValue + i);
  }
- For each loop was used for the palindrome
- A for each loop is used to loop through elements in an array or other data strucutes
- for(dataType variableName : arrayName){}
- eg    int intNumbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        for(int i : myNumbers)
        {
            cout << i << endl;
        }

- During the creation of option c, the palindrome I had to use a for each loop but the problem I was facing was that a for each loop only traverses
  forward so when adding to the word from the front.
- In order to combat this I used this module called std::reverse_iterate which iterates from the back using rbegin() and rend().
